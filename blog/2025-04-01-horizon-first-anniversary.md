**Today marks Horizon's 1st birthday, celebrating one amazing year of service!**
<!-- truncate -->
I started this project by hosting all my services and projects on a friend's server used for a Minecraft Greek network. After that project came to an end, I focused all my free time on Horizon. I bought my own servers, and with the help of my friend Alexander, one of my goals came true, which was: having my own servers and hosting my own projects.

On January 4th, I released version v1.0.0, the first public release of the bot. Since the bot was related to a specific theme, I didn’t have big goals for it. But it was something I loved and still love, and I wanted to share this astronomy vision with others here on Discord. Later, I invited some other of my friends to contribute, test, and create the branding for Horizon under our group name Atlas, a group of friends who made all of this possible. And that’s how Horizon was born.

### **As one year has passed, I’d like to thank these teams and users:**

Alexander; He’s been here since the beginning as a server administrator and a great friend.
CuriousAnaLyst; An friend who created Horizon's branding. Yes, you heard right, it’s not from Google, LOL.
Michael & JohnPapath; Friends, contributors and testers who gave me amazing feedback and reviews, which I truly appreciated.
The Space Devs (thespacedevs.com); This non-organizational team has been essential to Horizon's success. Without them, 60% of the bot's features wouldn’t exist, and possibly the bot itself. They’ve done an amazing job, and I’m really thankful for their help. Horizon uses 5 different APIs, but Space Devs is definitely the most important.

And of course, thank you to all the users who continue to use and support Horizon. Because let’s face it.. space is cool with the right tools, isn’t it?

🎉 To celebrate Horizon’s 1st anniversary, we’re sharing some exciting updates on the rewrite! More details are available on our Discord server. Feel free to join and share your thoughts. The invite link is in the website’s footer!

**Happy Birthday, Horizon! :rocket::birthday:**
