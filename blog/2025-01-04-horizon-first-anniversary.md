**Today marks Horizon's 1st birthday, celebrating one amazing year of service!**
<!-- truncate -->
I started this project by hosting all my services and projects on a friend's server used for a Minecraft Greek network. After that project came to an end, I focused all my free time on Horizon. I bought my own servers, and with the help of my friend Alexander, one of my goals came true, which was: having my own servers and hosting my own projects.

On January 4th, I released version v1.0.0, the first public release of the bot. Since the bot was related to a specific theme, I didnâ€™t have big goals for it. But it was something I loved and still love, and I wanted to share this astronomy vision with others here on Discord. Later, I invited some other of my friends to contribute, test, and create the branding for Horizon under our group name Atlas, a group of friends who made all of this possible. And thatâ€™s how Horizon was born.

### **As one year has passed, Iâ€™d like to thank these teams and users:**

- Alexander; Heâ€™s been here since the beginning as a server administrator and a great friend.
- Comfy; An friend who created Horizon's branding. Yes, you heard right, itâ€™s not from Google, LOL.
- Michael & JohnPapath; Friends, contributors and testers who gave me amazing feedback and reviews, which I truly appreciated.
- The Space Devs (thespacedevs.com); This non-organizational team has been essential to Horizon's success. Without them, 60% of the bot's features wouldnâ€™t exist, and possibly the bot itself. Theyâ€™ve done an amazing job, and Iâ€™m really thankful for their help. Horizon uses 5 different APIs, but Space Devs is definitely the most important.

And of course, thank you to all the users who continue to use and support Horizon. Because letâ€™s face it.. space is cool with the right tools, isnâ€™t it?

ðŸŽ‰ To celebrate Horizonâ€™s 1st anniversary, weâ€™re sharing some exciting updates on the rewrite! More details are available on our Discord server. Feel free to join and share your thoughts. The invite link is in the websiteâ€™s footer!

**Happy Birthday, Horizon! :rocket::birthday:**
