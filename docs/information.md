## How Horizon Works

Curious about the magic behind Horizon? Our bot is hosted on Atlas Servers and managed by a team of developers and friends who love space as much as you do. Horizon runs on the exclusive Horizon API, developed by Atlas Developers, and is connected to a MongoDB database.

The Horizon API aggregates data from six different providers, handling rate limits like a pro and updating the database with fresh info every few minutes. Horizon checks for new data and delivers it through commands and automations to all servers with these features enabled. It's like having your own personal astronomer in your Discord server, always ready with the latest space news!

## Supporting Horizon

Feeling generous? You can support the Horizon team by donating on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/atlasteam). Your donations help keep the cosmic wheels turning, and we appreciate every bit of support! If you're short on space credits, you can still help out for free by recommending Horizon to other community owners or voting for us on [top.gg](https://top.gg/bot/1183177251316047983).

:::tip
You can vote for Horizon on top.gg every 12 hours. Votes reset at the end of each month, so keep those votes coming to help us reach new galaxies!

## Data Collection

We know privacy is as important as knowing the next meteor shower. Horizon only collects data for statistical analysis and error logging purposes. We're not interested in your personal data – pinky promise.

So there you have it, space cadet! You're all set to launch Horizon into your Discord server and start exploring the universe. Happy stargazing!
